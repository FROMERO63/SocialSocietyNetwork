# SocialSocietyNetwork


## Description

This motivation for this project was to create a social network api where we could house, create and modify users, their thoughts, and reactions
This was a great project to practice api management
The project could be modified in many ways to create different social sites.
This solved the problem of users wanting to connect with other users in a social platform
I learned how to work with mongodb and get more practive with insomnia


## Installation

Worked to set up the models, routes, and controllers to create a database that we could work in mongobd and connect to insomnia

## Usage

RUn npm run start to connect to api. DB is then connected to the mongodb database

Use insomnia to manage the db and run get,post,delete, and put commands
